# Things I have learnt
In the process of completing the project, I have learned many components about motherboards. I have learnt that the motherboard is the most important components of a computer, that if it had not been part of the computer, the computer will have not been able to function. For example, Most of the components of the motherboard are necessary to make a motherboard such as the CPU, RAM slots, flash ROM, and the sockets. For example, I now know that the most important part of a motherboard is the CPU because without it the computer would not be able to function.
