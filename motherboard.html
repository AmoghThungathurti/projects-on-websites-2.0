 <h1>Motherboards</h1>
 
<p>The motherboard is the PCB that is the home of many of the vital components of a computor such as the CPU, CPU fans, intergrated 
graphics/graphics cards and the BIOS</p>

<h2>Origins of the Motherboard </h2>

<p>Before the creation of the motherboard, the components such as the CPU, the BIOS, the memory and the peripherals were placed on 
seperate printed circuit boards, making the PC much larger. In the late 1980's, many PC companies were making their PC's with the 
components on seperate PCB's, until Apple and IBM had chosen to place most of the required parts on the same PCB, hence the name 
motherboard (because that is the hub where all of the components are located) These leaders of innovation had made rough and ready
motherboards, that many companies had copied and made slight changes to, leading to the reason that there are so many companies 
producing computers to date.</p>

<h2>The Funtions of the Motherboard</h2>

<p>As stated beforehand, the motherboard is the main hub for most of the required components of the computer. The components are:
<ul>
    <li>Sockets (Microprocessors location)</li>
    <li>RAM slots</li>
    <li>A chipset</li>
    <li>Flash ROM (SSD, BIOS) </li>
    <li>Clock generator (syncronization of pc components) </li>
    <li>Power connectors (distributes power to the cpu)</li>
    <li>Connectors (Typically for hard drives)
</ul>

<h3>The Uses of the Motherboard</h3>

<p>The motherboard is, as stated many a times the most important part of a computer, as it is the host to the CPU. The motherboard takes 
the power from the outlet and distributes it around the computer to all of the main components such as the fans, the memory and the
other components of the motherboard. The RAM used for the computer is used by the CPU, to make sure that the computer does not overclock
and crash from running out of memory.</p>
